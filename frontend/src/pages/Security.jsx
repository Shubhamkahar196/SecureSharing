              <h3>Encryption in Transit</h3>
              <p>All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using TLS 1.3, the latest and most secure encryption protocol. This ensures that your files and personal information cannot be intercepted during upload or download.</p>
              
              <h3>Encryption at Rest</h3>
              <p>Your files are encrypted when stored on our servers using AES-256 encryption, the same standard used by banks and government agencies. Even if someone gained physical access to our servers, your files would remain protected.</p>

            <div className="security-details">
              <h3>Secure Authentication</h3>
              <p>We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication. Your password is hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds, making it virtually impossible to reverse-engineer even if our database were compromised.</p>
              
              <h3>Unique Share Links</h3>
              <p>Every file gets a unique, randomly generated sharing link that's virtually impossible to guess. These links use UUID4 format with 122 bits of entropy, providing excellent security against brute-force attacks.</p>
              
              <h3>Access Logging</h3>
              <p>We log all file access attempts for security monitoring. This helps us detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts while maintaining your privacy.</p>

              <h3>Password Protection</h3>
              <p>Add an extra layer of security by setting passwords for your files. Passwords are hashed and stored securely, and only users with the correct password can access your content.</p>
              
              <h3>Expiration Dates</h3>
              <p>Set automatic expiration dates for your files. Once expired, files are permanently deleted from our servers and cannot be recovered, ensuring your content doesn't remain accessible indefinitely.</p>
              
              <h3>View Limits</h3>
              <p>Control how many times your files can be viewed. This is perfect for one-time sharing or limiting distribution to a specific number of people.</p>
